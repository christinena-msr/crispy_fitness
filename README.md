Crispy Fitness Tracker

## Overview
Welcome to the Crispy Fitness Tracker App! You are on your way to achieving a health body.
You can track your exercises and manage your daily workouts all in one place.
To keep you motivated, you can even keep track of your progress in our `stats` section.

Don't let your fitness goals stay just a New Year's Resolution that stops after February.
